        <b>Phnom Penh</b>, Cambodia’s busy capital,<br>
         sits at the junction of the Mekong and Tonlé Sap rivers.<br>
        It was a hub for both the
        Khmer Empire and French colonialists.<br>
         On its walkable riverfront, lined with parks, restaurants and bars,<br>
          are the ornate
        Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda and the National Museum,<br>
         displaying artifacts from around the country.
